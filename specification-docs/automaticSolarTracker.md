# Advanced Solar Tracking System Using Arduino

## Description

The **Advanced Solar Tracking System** is an IoT-based project that maximizes the efficiency of solar panels while incorporating smart features for enhanced functionality and protection. The system uses an Arduino UNO to automate solar panel alignment with the sun, log data to the cloud, protect against rain, and deter birds. It also includes a nighttime shutoff feature to conserve energy.

## Features

1. **Sun Tracking**: Aligns the solar panel with the sun for optimal energy collection.
2. **Nighttime Shutoff**: Turns off the system at night to save energy.
3. **Rain Detection**: Detects rain and tilts the panel to prevent water pooling.
4. **Bird Detection**: Identifies birds near the panel and activates a buzzer to shoo them away.
5. **Cloud Logging**: Logs panel orientation, environmental conditions, and system status to the cloud.

## Components Used

- **Arduino UNO**: Microcontroller for managing all system functionalities.
- **Small Solar Panel**: Demonstration solar panel for energy collection.
- **Servo Motor**: Adjusts the solar panel's angle based on sunlight.
- **Two LDR Sensors**: Detect sunlight intensity on either side of the panel.
- **Rain Sensor**: Detects rainfall to adjust panel orientation for protection.
- **PIR Sensor**: Detects bird movement near the panel.
- **Buzzer**: Activates to deter birds.
- **WiFi Module (e.g., ESP8266)  (id required)**: Logs system data to the cloud.
- **Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module  (if required)**: Keeps track of time for nighttime shutoff.
- **Male-to-Male Jumper Wires (10)**: Establish electrical connections.
- **9V Battery**: Provides power to the system.
- **9V Battery Cap**: Connects the 9V battery to the power circuit.
- **Power Jack**: Connects the battery to the Arduino.

## System Design

### Working Principle

1. **Sun Tracking**: 
   - The LDR sensors detect sunlight intensity.
   - The Arduino calculates the difference in intensity and adjusts the servo motor to align the panel with the sun.

2. **Nighttime Shutoff**: 
   - Using the RTC module, the Arduino identifies nighttime and powers down the system to save energy.

3. **Rain Protection**: 
   - The rain sensor detects rainfall.
   - When rain is detected, the Arduino tilts the panel to a vertical position to avoid water pooling.

4. **Bird Detection**: 
   - The PIR sensor identifies movement near the panel.
   - When a bird is detected, the Arduino activates the buzzer to scare it away.

5. **Cloud Logging**: (id required)
   - The WiFi module connects the system to the cloud.
   - Logs such as sunlight intensity, panel orientation, rain status, and bird detections are sent to a cloud database.


### Software Design

The Arduino sketch includes:
- **Sun Tracking Logic**: Reads LDR values, calculates intensity differences, and controls the servo motor.
- **Nighttime Detection**: Uses RTC to turn off the system during the night.
- **Rain Detection**: Monitors rain sensor and tilts the panel during rainfall.
- **Bird Detection and Deterrence**: Activates buzzer upon detecting birds with the PIR sensor.
- **Cloud Logging**: Sends data to the cloud using the WiFi module.
- **Loop Functionality**: Continuously monitors sensors and adjusts the system.
