# IoT-based Waste Management System

## Description

The IoT-based Waste Management System is designed to automate the process of waste disposal by burning waste materials to generate electricity. This electricity is used to power a bulb and fan. The system integrates multiple sensors, including flame detection, temperature monitoring, and IoT communication, to ensure efficient waste burning and remote control. 

The setup uses a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) to convert the heat generated from burning waste materials into electricity. This system is powered by an Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller and can be controlled and monitored remotely over Wi-Fi. The entire system aims to provide a sustainable and automated way to manage waste while generating energy.

## Components

### **Hardware Components**
- **Microcontroller**: 
  - Arduino Uno or ESP32/ESP8266 (for IoT connectivity)
  
- **Temperature Sensor**:
  - DHT11 or DHT22 (for monitoring the temperature during the burning process)
  
- **Flame Sensor**:
  - MQ-9 (for detecting flame presence during waste burning)
  
- **Gas Sensor** (optional):
  - MQ-2 (for detecting harmful gases released during burning)
  
- **Relay Module**:
  - Used for controlling high-power devices like the bulb and fan
  
- **Power Generation Setup**:
  - Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) to convert heat into electricity.
  
- **Load Devices**:
  - LED Bulb (or incandescent bulb)
  - DC Fan
  
- **DC-DC Converter**:
  - Used to regulate the voltage produced by TEG to power the bulb and fan.

- **Wi-Fi Module**:
  - ESP8266 or ESP32 for IoT connectivity and remote control
  
- **Burner Chamber**:
  - A container for burning waste materials, connected to the thermoelectric generator.

### **Other Components**:
- Jumper wires, resistors, breadboard, etc.

## System Design

### **Overview**
The system consists of the following primary blocks:
1. **Waste Burning and Power Generation**:
   - The waste is burned in a controlled chamber, and a thermoelectric generator (TEG) converts the heat produced into electrical energy.
   - The generated power is passed through a DC-DC converter to ensure a stable voltage supply for the bulb and fan.

2. **Sensors**:
   - **DHT11/DHT22**: These sensors monitor the temperature in the burning chamber to ensure safe operation. If the temperature exceeds a threshold, the system can activate cooling measures or shut down.
   - **MQ-9**: This flame sensor detects the presence of a flame, ensuring that only burning waste generates electricity. If no flame is detected, the system will not generate power.

3. **Actuators**:
   - **Relay Module**: Used to control the operation of the bulb and fan based on inputs from the flame and temperature sensors.
   - The relay is activated when the system detects the presence of flame and appropriate temperature.

4. **Microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32)**:
   - The Arduino or ESP32 processes the sensor inputs, controls the relay, and manages the logic for turning the bulb and fan on/off.
   - The system is also connected to Wi-Fi using the ESP8266/ESP32 module, enabling remote control and monitoring.

5. **Remote Monitoring and Control (IoT)**:
   - The system serves a simple web interface or uses an IoT platform like ThingSpeak or Blynk for real-time data monitoring.
   - Users can access the system over a local network or via the internet to check sensor readings and control the relay remotely.

## How It Works
1. The **waste materials** are burned in the chamber.
2. The **flame sensor (MQ-9)** detects the presence of a flame.
3. The **temperature sensor (DHT11/DHT22)** monitors the temperature to ensure it is safe and efficient.
4. The **Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)** converts the heat produced by the burning waste into electrical energy.
5. This electrical energy is passed through a **DC-DC converter** to power the **bulb** and **fan**.
6. The **microcontroller (Arduino/ESP32)** processes the data from the sensors, turning the **bulb** and **fan** on/off as needed. It also communicates with the **Wi-Fi module** to send sensor data and receive control commands.
7. The **user can monitor** and control the system remotely using a web interface or mobile application.


This project integrates waste management with renewable energy production using a Thermoelectric Generator (TEG) and IoT technology for monitoring and control. The system automatically burns waste to generate electricity, which is used to power household devices like a bulb and fan, while also allowing remote monitoring and control over the internet.
